# rocket-launch-calendar

The goal of this project is to give users information about rocket launches and notify them when a rocket is going to be launched.
The app consists of a news page where the latest space related news is shown and a calendar where the user can see all scheduled rocket launches.
The user is also able to subscribe to specific launches to get notifications when the launch is happening.
